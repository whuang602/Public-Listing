# Public-Listing
Repo &amp; README that lists out Project repos that cannot be made public. Can be shown to recruiters upon request.

<h2> AI/Machine Learning Projects </h2>

Contains: Pacman AI built using reinforcment learning techniques as well as planning agents, hand-crafted perceptron linear classifier, handcrafted mini-batch SGD using logistic loss, Movie Review Positivity Detector w/ Bag of Words
  
Reasoning: code must be kept private to prevent cheating in AI/Machine Learning and related courses

<h2> Low Level CPU simulation (in Python3 with PyRTL library and some assembly) </h2>

Contains: single cycle CPU, pipelined CPU, 2-bit predictor and branch history table, 4-way associative cache, 2-level page table walker, 16-entry reorder buffer
  
Reasoning: code must be kept private to prevent cheating in computer architecture and related courses

<h2> Brokerage System (in Java, JDBC & Oracle) </h2>

Contains: backend code for connecting to Oracle DB, basic terminal "frontend" code for user interaction, SQL code for inserting test data

Reasoning: code must be kept private to prevent cheating in database and related courses

<h2> CFlat Compiler </h2>

Contains: a hand rolled compiler written completely in C++ for a custom Rust-like language

Reasoning: code must be kept private to prevent cheating in compiler and related courses

<h2> NACHOS Reimplementation </h2>

Contains: manual reimplementation of OS functionalities, eg. shell, read & write lock, and threading

Reasoning: code must be kept private to prevent cheating in OS and related courses

<h2> Custom Compiler and Interpreter </h2>

Contains: a basic compiler built using C++ & LLVM, and a basic work-in-progress interpreter being built in Java

Reasoning: They are shy. Also work in progress.

<h2> Discord Bot, codename Qutey (in Python3) </h2>

Contains: a self-contained bot that can run python code in discord servers, i.e. it runs code an user types in server chat.

Reasoning: It's a fun project but there are potentially A LOT of security vulnerabilities.
